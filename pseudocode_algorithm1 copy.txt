Create a Student class with name and total attributes

Constructor(name, studentId, a1, a2, a3):
            Set name
            Set total as sum of a1, a2, and a3

Define getters for the name, and the total and a setter for the total

Create a second file with a new class called StudentsMarksA2

Class StudentsMarksA2:
    List students
    String path

For this classe's constructor, take path as a parameter, and assign this.path=path and this.students=new ArrayList<>()

Method readFile():
        Try:
            Open file at path
            Skip first two lines
            While there is another line:
                Try
                    Create array from line elements split by comma 
                    Create new Student object with array elements
                    Add Student objetc to students list
                Catch 
                    Print student names that do not have all values for the array
        Catch FileNotFound:
            Print error message
            Rerun readFile
        Catch IOException:
            Print error message

Declare another method by declaring public void topAndBottom() {} to handle the algorithm 2's function
Call sort() method
        Use bubble sort to sort students ArrayList by total marks
Print "Students with highest marks:"
        For first 5 elements:
            Print name of student at (size of students - i - 1) index using getter method
        Print "Students with lowest marks:"
        For i=0 to i=4:
            Print name of student at students.length-i index using getter method
Method main():
        Get file path from user
        Create StudentsMarksA2 object with path
        Execute algorithm 2
